          <h1>A Little History About us</h1>
          <p>
            The Exmouth View hotel occupied one of the finest locations in
            Torquay, famed as the imaginary home of John Cleese's Fawlty Towers.
            There was nothing Fawlty about this hotel though. The welcome was
            said to be warm and friendly and it attracted some excellent reviews
            over the years.
          </p>
          <h1>Why was demolition considered?</h1>
          <p>
            It was a little dated however. Originally built out of two Victorian
            houses which had been knocked into one and then extensively extended
            it had a 1970s look about it and a few visitors complain that it was
            badly in need of updating. <br />
            <br />
            Running a hotel is an expensive business and this one not only
            occupied a fair bit of land in an area where there was high demand
            for housing, but the views from the rear were superb. It was ripe
            for conversion into housing, and in 2019 a proposal to knock it down
            and build 12 apartments and two townhouses on the site was debated
            and approved by Torbay Council's Development Management Committee.

        <h1>Were there objections?</h1>
        <p>
          The plot had quite a sizeable car park which was ample for the number
          of guests but since part of this was to be built over parking was
          going to become an issue locally, in an area which was already
          suffering from strain in this respect during the summer months. A
          number of parking spaces were to be prepared but it was obvious that
          some more would have been desirable.
          <br />
          <br />
          This was not the only objection. Following a circulation of details of
          the proposed development a total of 37 comments were received, all of
          them against the plans. Residents of a retirement home called
          Homecombe House, which was built in 1984, were concerned about loss of
          light and their windows being overlooked. Others felt that access of
          emergency vehicles could be affected by the increase in expected
          parking issues and that the demolition and rebuilding work would cause
          an unacceptable level of dust, noise and traffic congestion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-us2-row">
        <h1>What was the Planning Department's decision?</h1>
        <p>
          All factors were taken into consideration however and it was felt that
          the removal of a fairly unattractive building and its replacement with
          a carefully designed one would create an asset to the area, rather
          than a misfortune. The plans were approved, subject to a number of
          conditions regarding the exact design of the property and materials to
          be used, and an agreed schedule for the works to be carried out in a
          manner to minimise noise and inconvenience for local residents.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whilst it was felt that the loss of a hotel in a popular tourist area
          was a retrograde step it was not the most attractive of buildings and
          the fact was that there was a need for more housing in an area of high
          demand.
